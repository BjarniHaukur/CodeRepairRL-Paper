\chapter{Interactive Sankey Diagrams}
\label{app:sankey}

This appendix contains interactive Sankey diagrams that visualize command flow patterns during training. These HTML-based visualizations show how tool usage patterns evolve throughout the training process.

\section{Available Sankey Visualizations}

The following interactive Sankey diagrams are available in the \texttt{plotting/figures/plots/sankey/} directory:

\subsection{Run Comparison: c8qr1evt vs tfk08zx2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{early\_training\_sankey\_c8qr1evt.html} - Early training command flows for GSPO approach
\item \texttt{late\_training\_sankey\_c8qr1evt.html} - Late training command flows for GSPO approach
\item \texttt{early\_training\_sankey\_tfk08zx2.html} - Early training command flows for GRPO approach  
\item \texttt{late\_training\_sankey\_tfk08zx2.html} - Late training command flows for GRPO approach
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Training Runs}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{early\_training\_sankey\_nz1r7ml3.html} - Early training for baseline run
\item \texttt{late\_training\_sankey\_nz1r7ml3.html} - Late training for baseline run
\item Temperature-controlled runs (T5, T25) for various configurations
\end{itemize}

\section{Usage Instructions}

To view these visualizations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the HTML files in a web browser
\item Interact with the flow diagrams to explore command transition patterns
\item Compare early vs. late training to observe learning progression
\item Use hover tooltips to see detailed flow statistics
\end{enumerate}

These diagrams complement the static plots in Chapter~\ref{ch:results} by providing detailed insights into the sequential decision-making patterns learned by the agents.

\chapter{Additional Experimental Data}
\label{app:data}

\section{Complete Training Metrics}

This appendix would contain complete training logs and additional metrics that supplement the main results in Chapter~\ref{ch:results}.

\todoinline{Include additional data tables, extended statistical analyses, and supplementary experimental results once available.}
