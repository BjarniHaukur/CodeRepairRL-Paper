* Prefer insightful, cohesive text over enumerations.
* Calibrate certainty with cautious verbs when evidence is limited.

## LaTeX

* Do not add packages or change the preamble.
* Use existing macros. Prefer `\( ... \)` for inline math and `\[ ... \]` or `equation` for display math.
* Number only equations that are referenced. Use `\label{}` and `\eqref{}`.

* If information is missing, insert \todoinline{} with a terse comment

## Return Checklist
